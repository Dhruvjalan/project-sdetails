1. First, add the water, sugar and coffee powder to a blender/mixie. Pulse it 2 or 3 times until the sugar and coffee powder is dissolved.

2. Add the milk, vanilla ice cream and blend nicely for 2 mins or so until everything is combined well and frothy.

3. Serve cold.


Notes
- If you do not want to add ice cream, skip it. Instead add 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 1 Tbsp additional sugar.

- Instead of blending the ice cream in, you can also serve it on top of the coffee.

- Instead of vanilla ice cream, for a variation you can use chocolate ice cream. Also, optionally you can add in 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract.

- To get more adventurous, you can top it off with whipped cream as well.

- Adjust the quantity of ice cream as per your desire. Add more for a creamier and thicker coffee.
